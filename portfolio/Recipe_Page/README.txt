This is the first Techtonica project.

The project is a recipe page, involving HTML, CSS, and JS (DOM manipulation).
My project is called "Mom's First Spaghetti" and is a horrible spaghetti recipe.

Don't use this recipe for your spaghetti.
-----------------------------------------

The DOM manipulation makes the buttons on the page collapse and expand the Ingredients list, Equipment list, and the list of Steps, as well as the Warnings & Recommendations section at the bottom.
