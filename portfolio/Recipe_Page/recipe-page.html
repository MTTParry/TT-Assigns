            <h2>What's so special about this spaghetti?</h2>
                <article id="intro">
                    <p>The first time my mom made spaghetti, it was because her mom was out and needed somebody else to make dinner that night. My mom was the oldest kid and so the responsibility fell to her. Grandma thought, "What's so hard about spaghetti?" and my mom showed her.</p>
                    <p>My mom did not know why her mom provided two pots and simply cooked it all in one pot.</p>
                    <p>Long story short, she was never asked to make dinner again.</p>
